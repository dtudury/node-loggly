# node-loggly

the best documentation is currently reading the files in ./examples/
(edit ./examples/credentials.js with your info)

## todo

* make actual documentation
* tests...
* honor previous contributors
* non-success handling (including at the very least exponential backoff for the obvious ones)
* write de-promise-ify'ing wrapper
* write a better readme...
